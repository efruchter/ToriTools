A tiled xml level editor and Jython scripting interface.

See the Downloads Tab for the latest working version and a sample map.

The top level packages are 
1) toritools, the level editor and jython module.
2) samplegame, the tiny zelda clone that will be built alongside toritools to flesh out the features. Uses lwjgl.

HOW-TO INSTALL:
Create a blank java project in eclipse called ToriTools, 
and drag the git repo onto it and merge. Add all the jars 
and their natives (if they have them) to the build path.

ENABLE OPENGL YOU FOOOOL!

As a VM argument, pass in:
-Dsun.java2d.opengl=true
This will make things runs nice and smooth on OpenJDK. It seems to actually hurt performance on Windows 7, JVM7. WIERD.
