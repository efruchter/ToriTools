How to add new levels:

Burd will automatically load levels based on simple rules!
First, the first level to be loaded is level1.xml.
Then, every level after that is loaded in order, level#.xml.
When there are no more level files in thei format, the game is over.

To make a new level:
Duplicate an existing one
load it up in LevelEditor
and the Delete All to start fresh
