How to make your own campaign:

Edit the campaign.conf file in the snakemeleon directory, and add your levels to the file.
The game will automatically load it on startup.

In your levels, make sure you set this level variable in the editor:

var: background
value: snakemeleon/"path to your background image"

This variable is used to set a nice bg image. To make your life easier, you can just duplicate and edit an existing level.

Bugs:

I don't have a Mac to test on, so I only know that this editor works for Windows and Linux.
If you come across a bug of any kind, make an issue on the ToriTools github repo, and I'll get to it right away.
